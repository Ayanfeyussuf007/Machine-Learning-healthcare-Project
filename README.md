#  Machine Learning for Healthcare Data

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a basic machine learning workflow using a healthcare dataset. The goal is to build a classification model that can predict a specific outcome (e.g., Hospital Type) based on various features within the dataset. This showcases data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using Python's scikit-learn library.

## Dataset
The dataset used is `hospital-data.csv`, which contains information about hospitals. For this project, we focus on predicting the `Hospital Type` based on other available features.

## Key Features Demonstrated
-   **Data Loading:** Reading data from a CSV file using Pandas.
-   **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values and converting categorical features into a numerical format using one-hot encoding.
-   **Data Splitting:** Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.
-   **Machine Learning Model Training:** Building a classification model using `RandomForestClassifier` from `scikit-learn`.
-   **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance using accuracy and a classification report.
-   **Model Persistence:** Saving the trained model for future use using `joblib`.

## Files in this Project
-   `python_project_2.py`: The main Python script containing the machine learning pipeline.
-   `hospital-data.csv`: The healthcare dataset used for training and testing the model.
-   `hospital_type_classifier.pkl`: The trained machine learning model saved as a pickle file.

## How to Run the Project
1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python installed. You will also need the following libraries:
    -   `pandas`
    -   `scikit-learn`
    -   `joblib`
    You can install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib
    ```
2.  **Clone the Repository:** If you haven't already, clone this repository to your local machine.
3.  **Place the Dataset:** Ensure `hospital-data.csv` is in the same directory as `python_project_2.py`.
4.  **Execute the Script:** Navigate to the `python_project_2` directory in your terminal and run the Python script:
    ```bash
    python python_project_2.py
    ```
    This will train the model, print evaluation metrics, and save the trained model as `hospital_type_classifier.pkl`.

## Analysis Highlights
-   The project demonstrates a complete, albeit simplified, machine learning pipeline from data preparation to model saving.
-   It highlights the importance of preprocessing categorical data for machine learning algorithms.
-   The classification report provides detailed metrics (precision, recall, f1-score) for each class, offering a deeper understanding of model performance beyond just overall accuracy.

## Future Enhancements
-   Perform more extensive feature engineering.
-   Experiment with different machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Gradient Boosting).
-   Implement hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
-   Cross-validation for more robust model evaluation.
-   Address class imbalance if present in the dataset.
